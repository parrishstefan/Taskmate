## B. Description of our App

Taskmate is a PyQt6-based app that is designed to help users organize their day by inputting tasks and activities they need to complete. The app allows users to create a schedule for a given day, and generates a clear and easy-to-follow schedule. With a simple and intuitive user interface, users can easily add tasks and set their priority level and duration. The app then optimizes the schedule to ensure that all tasks are completed within the given timeframe, without overlapping or conflicting with each other
